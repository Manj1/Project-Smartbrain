Project-Smartbrain Message
This is a simple dApp which 1-5 year olds can be taught to click on the Smartbrain Message icon on their smartscreens, and receive a postive Smartbrain message. Regular, consistent use is meant to positively affirm their sense of self worth e.g. SmartBrain Message 1: 'You know you are awesome!'
